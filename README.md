If working with two:
A completed RecyclerView with a custom adapter
Integration with an API created by backend with use of OkHTTP and Moshi
Use of two 3rd party libraries (weâ€™ve showcased a little bit of Firebase, showcased Glide, or feel free to explore: here are others)
At the minimum, three fully functional fragments with some system of navigation

Backend:
The backend API has many GET, POST, and DELETE requests for our many databases, which include users, organizations, coffee chat requests, orgaization requests, etc. For example, we have a get all users, post new user, and delete user request. Our tables have many interconnecting relationships, such as a many to many relationship between users and organizations, or a one to many relationship between coffee chat requests and user.

Design:
Low fidelity sketches of design
Medium fidelity explorations of multiple flows in Figma
High fidelity prototype in Figma
UI design kit/design system in Figma
