## App Description
We noticed that when people are trying to coffee chat with others, in particular for club recruitment, they can face difficulties because the system for scheduling chats varies between organizations and coordinating schedules is tedious. With this people problem in mind, we decided to create “Latte Link,” a coffee chat scheduling app where people can see information about current members in an organization as well as the person’s availability.

## Requirements
The backend API has many GET, POST, and DELETE requests for our many databases, which include users, organizations, coffee chat requests, orgaization requests, etc. For example, we have a get all users, post new user, and delete user request. Our tables have many interconnecting relationships, such as a many to many relationship between users and organizations, or a one to many relationship between coffee chat requests and user.
